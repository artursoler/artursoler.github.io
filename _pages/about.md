Hi, I'm Artur, a software engineer. Welcome to my site!

I will blog here on an array of different computer science and programming related topics, including but not limited to distributed systems, networking or algorithms.

To get in contact with me, you can use my first name at this domain name.

This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) and it's [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/artursoler/artursoler.github.io).
